        Hello! I'm Sri Lakshmi Sowmya Mallipudi, and I'd like to share a bit about my background and journey with you. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering (B.Tech) and initially started my career in the technology industry as a Software Quality Assurance Engineer at Broadcom, Hyderabad, India. During my time there, I gained valuable experience in ensuring the quality and reliability of software products, which allowed me to develop a keen eye for detail and problem-solving skills.
        After getting married and relocating, I faced the challenge of transitioning to a new career path in the United States. To facilitate this transition, I applied for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) and embarked on a journey of exploration and self-discovery. To support myself during this transition, I took on the role of a Starbucks Barista, where I honed my customer service skills and learned the importance of adaptability and teamwork.
        Seeking to further expand my skill set and pivot into a different field, I decided to pursue my passion for web development. I was fortunate to gain admission to the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at the University of Minnesota, a decision that marked a significant turning point in my career. Through this intensive program, I delved into various programming languages, web development frameworks, and the intricacies of building modern web applications. This experience allowed me to develop a strong foundation in web development and a deep appreciation for the art of creating functional and visually appealing websites and web applications.
        As I continue to learn and grow in the world of web development, I am excited to combine my technical skills with my previous experience in quality assurance to deliver high-quality, user-friendly web solutions. My journey from a software quality engineer to a Starbucks barista and then to a full stack web developer has provided me with a diverse set of skills and a unique perspective that I am eager to apply to new challenges and opportunities in the tech industry.
        Thank you for taking the time to learn a little more about my background and experiences. I look forward to sharing my portfolio and showcasing the projects and skills I've acquired along the way.
